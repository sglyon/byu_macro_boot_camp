1.) Reduce will reduce all values on all processes to a single value on the root
    process one at a time.
    AllReduce will do the same thing as reduce, but it will pass the reduced
    value to all processes.

2.) Allreduce is faster than Reduce + Bcast because the Allreduce algorithm does
    all of it in one step, whereas the Reduce + Bcast method takes two steps.
